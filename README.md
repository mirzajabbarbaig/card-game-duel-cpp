C++ console Card Game Dual

A simple C++ console card duel game created for Programming Fundamentals (Assignment 2).

How it Works:
 1) A full 52-card deck is generated (ranks + suits)
 2) The deck is shuffled randomly
 3) Player and computer draw cards each round
 4) Higher rank wins the round
 5) If ranks tie, suit order decides the winner
 6) Best-of-three (first to 2 points wins)

Features:
 1) Deck creation using nested loops
 2) Random shuffle using "rand()" and "srand(time(0))"
 3) Rank + suit comparison logic
 4) Best-of-3 round system
 5) Replay option
